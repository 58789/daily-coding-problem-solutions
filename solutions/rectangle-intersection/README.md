Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.

For example, given the following rectangles:
```javascript
{
    topLeft: {
        x: 1,
        y: 4
    },
    dimensions: {
        width: 3,
        height: 3
    }
}
```
and

```javascript
{
    topLeft: {
        x: 0,
        y: 5
    },
    dimensions: {
        width: 4,
        height: 3
    }
}
```
return 6.
